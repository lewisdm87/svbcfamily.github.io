<h1><span>About our Church</span></h1>
	
<h2><span>Statement of Faith</span></h2>
<ol>
<li>We believe in the verbal inspiration and authority of the Scriptures. <br>
	We believe that the Bible reveals God, the fall of man, the way of salvation, and God's plan and purpose in the ages.
</li><br>
<li>
We believe in God the Father, God the son, and God the Holy Spirit.
</li><br>
<li>
We believe in the deity, virgin birth, and bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ.
</li><br>
<li>
We believe that salvation is by grace plus nothing and minus nothing. The conditions to salvation are repentance and faith.
</li><br>
<li>
We believe that men are justified by faith alone and are accounted righteous before God only through the merit of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Justification establishes an eternal relationship that can never be broken.
</li><br>
<li>
We believe in the visible, personal, and premillennial return of Jesus Christ.
</li><br>
<li>
We believe in the everlasting conscious blessedness of the saved and the everlasting conscious punishment of the lost.
</li>
</ol><br>

<h3><span>What is the Great Commandment?</span></h3>

<blockquote>
Jesus said: <br>
Love the Lord your God with all your heart... soul... and mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and Prophets hang on these two commandments.<br>
Matthew 22:36-48
</blockquote>

<h3><span>What is the Great Commission?</span></h3>

<blockquote>
Jesus said:<br>
Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.<br>
Matthew 28:19-20
