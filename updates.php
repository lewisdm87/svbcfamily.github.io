<p>Peggy Brewer is slowly recovering. She said her strength is coming back and she does feel better. She doesn&#39;t have much of a appetite but she is eating. She is quarantined and the doctor told her this will be in her body until January. So she won&#39;t be able to come to church until then. She wants to thank you all for the beautiful cards, phone calls and most of all your prayers. She misses her church and her church family!</p>
