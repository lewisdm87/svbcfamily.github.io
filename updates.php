<p>Subject - Update on Ernie Wiant</p>

<p>Ernie did well with his surgery. He lost a lot of blood during the surgery because of the injury. They have him in ICU because of low blood pressure. Gloria said he had a great doctor and nurses. </p>

<p>Gloria is having a hard time but is trusting the Lord. Much prayer is needed.</p>

<p>Can send cards to PO Box 268, Stephens City, VA 22655</p>

<p>Blessings</p>
