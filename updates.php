<p>GOD…As He longs for you to see Him</p>

<p>The Love of God</p>

<p>You know what happens to soda when you leave it sitting open?….it becomes flat! Has the word love become flat in our cultural vernacular? After all we use it to describe our affection for anything from our families to hot dogs. Sadly, those of us who have been in church for any length of time, the mantra ‘God loves you’ moved from humbling to humdrum years ago. God wants to move us from flat to flavorful, moving His love for us from our minds to our hearts. Coming to understand Gods love for us will go a long way in truly loving others; even those we seriously disagree with.</p>

<p>I.Five distinct implication of God’s love</p>

<p>A. God’s thoughts, intentions, desires and plans area always for your good and never for your harm. Her 29:11, James 1:17</p>

<p>B. God is kind, open, approachable, frank, and eager to be your friend. John 13:12-15</p>

<p>C. God emotionally identifies with your pain, joy, hopes, and dreams and has chosen to allow your happiness to affect His own. John 11:33-36</p>

<p>D. He takes pleasure in you just for who you are totally apart from your performance and/or accomplishments. Ps 139, Zeph 3, Rom 5:8</p>

<p>E. God is actively and creatively orchestrating people, circumstances, and events to express His affection and selective correction to provide for your highest good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>”The Lord your God is with you. He is mighty to save. He will take great delight in you, He will quiet you with His love, He will rejoice over you with singing” - Zeph 3:17</p>
</blockquote>

<p>II. Definition of God love,</p>

<p>God’s love is His holy disposition toward all that He has created that compels Him to express unconditional affection and selective correction to provide the highest quality of existence, both now and forever, for the object of His love.</p>

<p>III.How do we respond to Gods love?</p>

<p>A. We must receive</p>

<p>B. We must believe</p>

<p>IV.Three ways to take the love of God from your head down into your heart.</p>

<p>A. Renew your mind</p>

<p>B. Pray and ask God to help</p>

<p>C. Refuse cheap substitutes</p>

<p>Question: What specific steps of faith/obedience are you going to take to help you experience and enjoy God’s unconditional love for you/</p>

<p>Happy Studying</p>

<p>Subject: Pastor’s Devotional</p>

<p>GOD - As He longs for you to see Him… ….The Justice of God</p>

<p>Amid all of the violence and destruction in our world today is “Where is God in all of this” a fair question? Some would look at the current riots taking place in major cities where personal private property is being destroyed by thieves and thugs and ask “where is God?” Another may look at pastor and his wife who has served the Lord faithfully for year only to have her succumb to cancer at an early age; “why didn’t God answer my prayer” one may ask? Even the writer of Ecclesiastes wondered this question when he wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I have seen everything during my lifetime of futility; there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his wickedness” - ECC 7:15 (NAS)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By His nature God is fair and righteous and just. In a fallen world, we don’t always get to experience God’s justice. God has repeatedly revealed His justice in:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The natural order

		<ul>
			<li>The human heart</li>
			<li>the Bible</li>
			<li>The Cross</li>
			<li>Divine retribution</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>“For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God. Having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit” - 1 Pet 3:18 (NAS)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I. How do we respond to God’s justice?</p>

<p>A. Choose to embrace Jesus</p>

<p>B. Refuse to seek vengeance</p>

<p>C. Take comfort in God’s justice</p>

<p>D. Meditate on the effects of God’s final judgement</p>

<p>READ: Ps 73: 1-17. What insights can you gain from this passage about justice?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “it is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord. On the contrary: “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.” Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.” - Rom 12:17-21</p>
</blockquote>
