<p><em>Urgent Prayer!!</em></p>

<p>Helen Weir was admitted to WMC this morning with an urgent prayer need!</p>

<p>She has a growth around her large intestine, around liver and kidneys. Please pray for her, her niece Jeanne Tally and sister Ellen Grant. </p>

<p>Please pray for my brother -in-law Dallas Hartley and my sister Carolyn.</p>

<p>Dallas has not been doing well for these months. He has been in the hospital and rehab and now back at home but is not doing well. He has a therapist coming to the house but is still unable to get up or do anything for himself. He had a liver transplant years ago and now this liver is failing with other health challenges.</p>

<p>My sister is not well either but is his on call 24 hour caregiver. It&#39;s very hard on her.</p>

<p>If you would like to send a card would be nice...</p>

<p>Subject - Update on Ernie Wiant</p>

<p>Ernie did well with his surgery. He lost a lot of blood during the surgery because of the injury. They have him in ICU because of low blood pressure. Gloria said he had a great doctor and nurses. </p>

<p>Gloria is having a hard time but is trusting the Lord. Much prayer is needed.</p>

<p>Can send cards to PO Box 268, Stephens City, VA 22655</p>

<p>Blessings</p>
