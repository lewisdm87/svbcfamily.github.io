<p>3 of 3 Emails today. &nbsp;Please pardon the number but trying to keep them short. &nbsp;One each on curriculum, training dates, and Zoom call.</p>

<p>Things are a little crazy these days and churches are making plans to reopen children&#39;s ministry on Sunday mornings as well as Awana. &nbsp;We have had several conversations with local churches plus we&#39;re gathering information from other Awana missionaries. &nbsp;A lot of great ideas customized to their church community and building resources. &nbsp;In an effort to share ideas we&#39;re scheduling two Zoom calls next week to have that discussion on a broader basis. &nbsp;Both calls will be the same format so you are welcome to attend one or both. &nbsp;Here&#39;s some of the areas for discussion:</p>

<p>Registration and arrival, small and large groups, game and activity times, and club dismissal. &nbsp;Some clubs are doing all onsite, others a hybrid, and we have some starting off as all online. &nbsp;How do you do safe social distancing and proper sanitary practices while still accomplishing discipleship? &nbsp;Hope that you can join us for the discussion. &nbsp;We have also included the latest Awana Around the World with the 125 countries using Awana to reach more than 4.8 million children. &nbsp;Your church is one of the 63,408 doing Awana to reach more kids.</p>

<p>2 of 3 Emails today. &nbsp;Please pardon the number but trying to keep them short. &nbsp;One each on curriculum, training dates, and Zoom call.</p>

<p>This year in the interest of safety and reaching more leaders, Awana is offering 11 Awana Ministry Conferences and 11 Awana Basics all online. &nbsp;The Awana Ministry Conferences will be held regionally and include general sessions plus 30+ workshops each. &nbsp;The conferences will be on Saturday mornings and start at 8:30 and run until noon. &nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>The Awana Basics are 90-minute training with about 2 hours of recommended prep work to make the best use of the time. &nbsp; 18 online modules are available to dive deeper after the training. &nbsp;There will also be materials available for either leaders or churches to do their own training.</p>
<br>
<p>Both of these opportunities to be better equipped are FREE! &nbsp;Registration information will soon be available but&nbsp;wanted to give you some dates to consider in the Eastern time zone. &nbsp;Any leader is welcome to go to any conference, even in another time zone. &nbsp;Churches can decide whether their leaders will just meet from home to attend or whether circumstances permitted they will gather together to attend. &nbsp;Some churches who do additional church specific training could do this in the afternoon following the Awana Ministry Conference. &nbsp;You may want to extend this invitation to potential leaders who may want more information before committing. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Subject - prayer needs and security meeting</p>

<p>Be in prayer for Garrett and Nicole as they head back to WV. Garrett’s grandfather had a massive heart attack this past week and the family has been called together to make the decision as to whether or not to disconnect him from the life sustaining equipment. Pray for God’s peace and comfort for the Sheppard family at this time.</p>

<p>A brief gathering will be held after the service tomorrow for those who have taken the security training in regards to forming a security team at SVBC. Those who attended along with those who would be interested in taking part are encouraged to attend as we decide when to hold a formal meeting ASAP to go over procedures and scheduling.</p>

<p>Please pray for Dallas Hartley and Carolyn as Dallas has been having some serious issues and had to be taken to the hospital today after the second fall this morning. He has been falling a lot. He also has stage 4 kidney failure. So pray that they will be able to get some rest and that this can be resolved in some way. (Connie Sales sister &amp; brother-in-law)</p>

<p>Subject: Pastor’s Devotional</p>

<p>Worn-Out Knees — Living a yielded life </p>

<p>John 14:12-14</p>

<p>Some might think it arrogant when they hear a Christian talk about doing greater works than Jesus. But it was Jesus himself who said His followers would do such works — not greater physical miracles, but spiritual miracles that would have their basis in a life of prayer. The key to Jesus&#39; power on earth was His relationship to the Father in heaven.</p>

<p>I. The EXPECTATION of greater works vs 12a</p>

<p>• The expectation of &quot;greater works&quot; has caused no small amount of confusion and controversy in the body of Christ.</p>

<p>• Jesus said what we would do would result in an even greater impact than what He had done.</p>

<p>II. The EXPLANATION of greater works vs 12b</p>

<p>• Jesus tied the &quot;greater works&quot; to His return to heaven</p>

<p>• Jesus returning to the Father and the Spirit&#39;s coming from the Father—the followers of Jesus would be able to ask of Jesus His help in carrying out His will, continuing to do His works — even greater!</p>

<p>III. The EXPRESSION of greater works vs 12b</p>

<p>• Approximately forty days after Jesus told the disciples about the &quot;greater works&quot;, He returned to heaven then ten days later, on Pentecost, the Holy Spirit was poured out on the disciples resulting in 3,000 coming to Christ! Never in Jesus&#39; ministry did 3,000 people believe in Him in a single day. The &quot;greater works&quot; had begun!</p>

<p>• The REACH of our ministry is greater</p>

<p>• The RESULT of our ministry is greater</p>

<p>IV. The EXECUTION of greater works vs 13-14</p>

<p>• The way we execute these &quot;greater works&quot; is through prayer: &quot;Whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in My name, I will do it&quot;</p>

<p>• It is better to have Jesus within us through the Spirit than beside us.</p>

<p>Ques: vs 10, How could obeying the Father&#39;s will and doing His work lead to conflict in the</p>

<p>world? Which is more important — avoiding conflict or doing God&#39;s will?</p>

<p>Ques: What good news about the Spirit&#39;s ministry is found in John 3:34?</p>

<p>Happy Studying</p>

<p>Subject: Peggy Brewer update</p>

<p>Peggy called yesterday and said she is doing just fine. She has no pain which she refused the pain pills from the doctor because she said I don&#39;t have any pain! </p>

<p>She thanks her SVBC family for all the prayers, lovely cards and phone calls. She said it was your prayers and God that brought her through her surgery and now her recovery. She said I will be back to church in a couple of weeks that she would come this Sunday but her family said that she needs to stay away a couple of weeks because of her immune system with this virus. She so loves getting cards. Even if you have already sent her one maybe send another one telling her you are so happy and thankful for her.</p>

<p>Be Blessed</p>
