<p>Subject: Pastor’s Devotional</p>

<p>SIGNS OF LIFE...Back to the basics of authentic Christianity </p>

<p><em>Dr. David Jeremiah</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>”You are the __ of the. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they ____ a __ and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives lights to all who are in the house.&quot; - Matt 5:14-15</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I. We are the light of the world</p>

<p>A. Light destroys darkness — John 1:5</p>

<p>• Salt holds back evil and its destruction, but light shines forth that which is good. We are light — manifesting righteousness — As we shine forth the light of Christ in this world, darkness will be driven back.</p>

<p>Ques: Why do you think evil seems to triumph so much in our world today?</p>

<p>B. Light detects evil — John 3:19-20</p>

<p>• Evil deeds of the world are illuminated by the presence of Christians in the world. In other words, the light of Christ is the standard, or benchmark, for righteousness.</p>

<p>• Without the light of Christ in the church, the evil deeds of the world would have nothing against which to be measured.</p>

<p>C. Light discovers good — John 3:21</p>

<p>• When those who are responding to the light come closer to the light of Christ present in the church, their deeds become clearly visible.</p>

<p>• It becomes obvious that God is at work in their life.</p>

<p>D. Light defines Christianity — Eph 5:8</p>

<p>• The Apostle Paul stated: though we were once we are now __ in the Lord, and should walk as __ of __</p>

<p>• We have been called as children of light — and light is the essence of Christianity.</p>

<p>• The darker the world around us gets, the brighter our light should shine.</p>

<p>Ques: How can our light shine bright in a sin darkened world?</p>

<p>E. Light demands exposure — Matt 5:14-16</p>

<p>• The purpose of light is to illuminate</p>

<p>• If our light is concealed by the fact that we stay home or stay at church and never let the world see our light, what is accomplished?</p>

<p>• For light to accomplish its purpose, it must leave the presence of other lights and go out into the darkness (IN the world but not the world)</p>

<p>Summation: When salt loses its flavor, Jesus said, it is worthless. And when a light is put under a basket,</p>

<p>it too is worthless. For the church to accomplish its purpose of PRESERVATION and ILLUMINATION we must go out into the world where decay and darkness are present. YOU can be as effective as one grain of salt and one candle — if only you will go where you are needed.</p>

<p>Happy Studying!</p>

<p>THE FIVE SIGNS OF LIFE...Back to the basics of authentic Christianity </p>

<p><em>by Dr. David Jeremiah</em></p>

<p>When a patient is brought into a hospital emergency room, he is immediately checked for &quot;vital signs&quot; of life. We could do the same check on the body of Christ. If we are not manifesting the same signs of life in our lives that Christ did, our world will never see Him as they should.</p>

<p>Just as there should be signs of life if someone is physically alive, so there should be signs of spiritual life as well — signs of spiritual life in those who profess to be followers of the Lord Jesus Christ. There are some signs of life that are recognized in the Christian community signs such as worship, Bible reading, giving, the fruit of the Spirit, and others. But there should also be signs of life that are recognized</p>

<p>outside the church — in the marketplace of this world. Jesus Christ was certainly recognized for the spiritual life that He manifested. And those that follow Him should also manifest clear signs of life.</p>

<p>I. Dusty Shoes — Living a relevant life — Matt 5:13-16</p>

<p> A. We are the Salt of the Earth:</p>

<ol>
	<li>1. Salt prevents Decay:</li>

		<p> • Left to itself, without outside efforts to preserve it, the world would decompose spiritually. The &quot;salt&quot; that God uses to preserve the world while the Gospel is being spread is the body of Christ — individual believers being &quot;salty&quot; in the world.</p>

		<p> • Believers are to be the voice for life, marriage, home, character, hope—Jesus!</p>

		<ol start="2">
			<li>2. Salt provides flavor:</li>

				<p> • Christ in us provides flavor in an unsavory world.</p>

				<p> • When one comes to know Christ, it seems as if everything changes. For that reason, there ought to be a significant difference in believers. II Cor 5:17</p>

				<p> • Do everything in such a way that people are drawn to the wonderful flavor of Jesus.</p>
			<li> 3. Salt promotes thirst:</li>

				<p> • We are to be the salt of the earth to make people want to drink deeply of the living water that is Jesus. &quot;If anyone ____ let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the ____ has said, out of his ____ will flow rivers of living water&quot; John 7:37-38</p>

				<p> • &quot;Preach the Gospel at all times, and if necessary use words.&quot; — Francis of Assisi</p></li>
			<li>4. Salt permeates food:</li>

				<p> • One person may be as small as a grain of salt compared to the world, but even one grain of salt is noticeable when tasted.</p>

				<p> • William Wilberforce is an example. Almost single-handedly he brought an end to England&#39;s participation in the slave trade. He was small, sickly, and did not appear to be a man of any great impact. God however used him to convict the English parliament that trafficking in human slaves was wrong. England outlawed the practice.</p>

<p>Next week We are the light of the world </p>

<p>HAPPY STUDYING</p>

<p>Subject: Prayer needs</p>

<p>Also please continue to pray for Mr. Sanford Silver. He is still in the hospital (ICU) he can mumble a little and is able to cough. They have taken the tube out of his throat and placed the food tube in his side. All vitals are holding steady with medication. This is small improvements but they are improvements! Your prayers are so needed for him. He loves it up here at SVBC and we miss seeing him.</p>
