<p>3 of 3 Emails today. &nbsp;Please pardon the number but trying to keep them short. &nbsp;One each on curriculum, training dates, and Zoom call.</p>

<p>Things are a little crazy these days and churches are making plans to reopen children&#39;s ministry on Sunday mornings as well as Awana. &nbsp;We have had several conversations with local churches plus we&#39;re gathering information from other Awana missionaries. &nbsp;A lot of great ideas customized to their church community and building resources. &nbsp;In an effort to share ideas we&#39;re scheduling two Zoom calls next week to have that discussion on a broader basis. &nbsp;Both calls will be the same format so you are welcome to attend one or both. &nbsp;Here&#39;s some of the areas for discussion:</p>

<p>Registration and arrival, small and large groups, game and activity times, and club dismissal. &nbsp;Some clubs are doing all onsite, others a hybrid, and we have some starting off as all online. &nbsp;How do you do safe social distancing and proper sanitary practices while still accomplishing discipleship? &nbsp;Hope that you can join us for the discussion. &nbsp;We have also included the latest Awana Around the World with the 125 countries using Awana to reach more than 4.8 million children. &nbsp;Your church is one of the 63,408 doing Awana to reach more kids.</p>

<p>2 of 3 Emails today. &nbsp;Please pardon the number but trying to keep them short. &nbsp;One each on curriculum, training dates, and Zoom call.</p>

<p>This year in the interest of safety and reaching more leaders, Awana is offering 11 Awana Ministry Conferences and 11 Awana Basics all online. &nbsp;The Awana Ministry Conferences will be held regionally and include general sessions plus 30+ workshops each. &nbsp;The conferences will be on Saturday mornings and start at 8:30 and run until noon. &nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>The Awana Basics are 90-minute training with about 2 hours of recommended prep work to make the best use of the time. &nbsp; 18 online modules are available to dive deeper after the training. &nbsp;There will also be materials available for either leaders or churches to do their own training.</p>
<br>
<p>Both of these opportunities to be better equipped are FREE! &nbsp;Registration information will soon be available but&nbsp;wanted to give you some dates to consider in the Eastern time zone. &nbsp;Any leader is welcome to go to any conference, even in another time zone. &nbsp;Churches can decide whether their leaders will just meet from home to attend or whether circumstances permitted they will gather together to attend. &nbsp;Some churches who do additional church specific training could do this in the afternoon following the Awana Ministry Conference. &nbsp;You may want to extend this invitation to potential leaders who may want more information before committing. &nbsp;</p>
