<h2>March 19, 2020</h2>

<p>In accordance with governmental guidlines the leadership staff at SVBC has decided on
the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>All scheduled events for the remainder of March have been cancelled.</li>
<li>Sunday and Wednesday night services will not be held.</li>
<li>The leadership team will be meeting again in April to determine operating status.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sunday Mornings</h3>

<p>The pastor will open the church Sunday Mornings from 10am - 11am for anyone who wishes
to come in and pray. The time of prayer is strictly voluntary and prayer groups will be
limited to a maximum of 10 persons. Please remember that government guidance includes
distances of approx. 6ft between people and to refrain from contact. It&#8217;s not being rude,
it&#8217;s being safe.</p>

<h3>Online Devotionals</h3>

<p>We are exploring options for Pastor Cherry to host online devotionals Sunday mornings and
Wednesday evenings. They will be short videos on Facebook Live and recordings will be
transfered to our YouTube channel for your convenience. Please be sure to follow our social
media channels and this page for updated information as it becomes available.</p>
