<h2>May 29, 2020</h2>

<p>With the updated guidelines and mandates from VA Governor, all members and guests will be required to wear a face mask while inside the SVBC buildings. While we do have a limited supply of masks available to provide; we encourage you to bring/wear your favorite from home. </p>

<p>Welcome back! Beginning May 24 the sanctuary will be open for the 10:30AM service ONLY. Please adhere to the following guidelines:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Those from the same household may sit together in the same pew; any others in the same pew must observe the six foot guideline.</li><br>
	
	<li>Every other pew will be empty in order to observe best “social distancing” practice.</li><br>
	
	<li>Ushers will assist and guide attendees in seating; you simply may not be able to sit in the pew you have grown used to. Your cooperation is appreciated.</li><br>
	
	<li>All parking spaces will be available at both entrances for your use.</li><br>
	
	<li>If you have a mask and so choose to wear it we certainly encourage you to do so. We will have some gloves and mask available on a limited basis, this due to items being hard to come by.</li><br>
	
	<li>In lieu of passing the offering plates a “drop box” will be available at each entry for your convenience. Thank you for your faithful stewardship during this far from normal time.</li><br>
	
	<li>We will do our best to keep everyone “in the loop” with regard to any changes and/or adjustments. Please be patient in and during this process.</li><br>
	
</ul>

<p>We plan on resuming the prayer meeting on Wednesday nights at 6:30pm starting Wed June 3rd. The meeting will be held in the SW corner section of the main auditorium as opposed to the Pastors office in order for social distancing to be observed.</p>

<p>We plan on resuming Sunday school gatherings at 9AM beginning Sun, June 7th.</p>

<p>In the mean time we will continue broadcasting the morning service on 87.9fm and live on Facebook at facebook.com/svbcfamily.</p>

<p>Tithes and offerings can be dropped into the drop boxes at either entrance or you can donate online at svbcfamily.com/donate.php and clicking on the PayPal button. We appreciate your faithful stewardship during this process of change.</p>
